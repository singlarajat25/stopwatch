# stopwatch

Hello, 

This is my JavaScript project on StopWatch and I hope you guys like it.

Now here comes the main stuff -

*Features:
1. Reload Sync:   This stopwatch has the ability to save its state when the user reloads the tab in which the timer is                         running, it will simply resumes from its previous state when the tab is reloaded. 
                
2. Reopen Sync:   This project also has sync feature when the user closes and reopens the browser window, just like above                       case, it simply just saves its state and then continues from it when the user reopens the browser window.

                  *Both of these features are performed with the help of Local Storage :)
                
3. History Panel: This project also has the ability of viewing last 10 history logs for user to compare its performance and                       other stuff.



*UseCases:
1. Start:         When the user clicks on Start, timer on the stopwatch starts running and will remain running even if user                     reloads/reopens browser window.

2. Pause:         When the user clicks on Pause, times on the stopwatch pause and will remain pause even if user                               reloads/reopens browser window.

3. Lap:           When the user clicks on Lap, a lap is created and displayed on Lap panel below the timer and it will remain                   displayed during reload/reopen event.

4. Reset:         When the user clicks on Reset, the timer on the stopwatch resets to 00:00:00 and all the laps are removed                     from the Lap panel and a new entry will be displayed inside history panel which will show the data of last                   run.

5. History:       When the user clicks on History, the history panel(hidden during start) will be displayed and will contain                   last 10 history logs. User can toggle the visibility of history panel anytime using history button.

6. Clear History: When the user clicks on clear history button(present inside history panel), all the enteries inside history                   panel will be wiped.



So here is the brief info about this project, I hope you guys like it and please give your feedbacks/suggestions for further improvements.
